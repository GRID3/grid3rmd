This R package provides R Markdown templates for the [GRID3](http://grid3.org/) project. These templates provide branded fonts, colour schemes and icons. The package can be installed from GitHub as follows:

```
devtools::install_github("GRID3/grid3rmd")
```

## Using the templates

The template includes output formats for PDF, HTML and Word. These are available through RStudio through `File -> New -> RMarkdown -> From Template`, where `GRID3 Template` and `GRID3 Training Template`, or by changing the output format in the  the YAML of your R Markdown document using the following:

```
output:
  grid3rmd::html_grid3: default
  grid3rmd::pdf_grid3: default
  grid3rmd::word_grid3: default
```

An example of the outputs is shown below:

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/screenshot.png")
```

## Custom Blocks

The templates include a range of [custom blocks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) which can be used in documents. The options available include **tip**, **question**, **exercise**, **important**, **rmdnote**, **rmdcaution**, **rmdimportant**, **rmdtip**, **rmdwarning**. These are used within code chunks by setting the header as `{block2, type = "tip"}` and including markdown text within the chunk. The full set of options are shown below:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/customChunks.png")
```
